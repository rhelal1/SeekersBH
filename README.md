## Design Changes
This section outlines updates made to the design of SeekersBH. These include refinements to improve user experience and functionality:

1. **[Feature: Online Courses]**
- Change:
    In the online courses screen, a new button has been added to allow users to view all their obtained certifications. When clicked, this button navigates the user to a screen displaying all their certifications, where they can select one to manage. Upon selection, they are taken to another screen to manage the certification. Here, the user can remove the certificate or choose a CV from their CV list to add the certification to it.
- Reason for the Change:
    This change was implemented to address the issue of users not being able to easily view their obtained certifications. By enhancing the user experience with this feature, users can now conveniently manage their certifications, improving the overall usability and functionality of the app.
